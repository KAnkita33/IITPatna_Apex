###TrenGenz###
Overview

The TrenGenz feature is a specialized column within our project that focuses on Gen Z trends in fashion. It highlights trending styles accompanied by popular hashtags such as #retrofuturistic and #cottagecore, ensuring Gen Z users stay connected with the latest social trends and hashtags. This feature addresses the Gen Z fear of missing out (FOMO) by providing curated selections of trending styles, fostering a sense of community, and ensuring users feel informed and connected.
